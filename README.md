This project explores the simulation of decision-making processes in the brain by modelling the dopamine reward system. Inspired by the brainâ€™s mechanism of prioritizing actions that maximize dopamine release, I aimed to understand how decision-making can be optimized using computational models. The focus of the project is on the intersection of learning, prediction, and rewards, with applications to neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The primary objective was to create a simulation that mimics the way the brain rewards certain actions through dopamine release. I aimed to simulate how these reward signals are processed using the Rescorla-Wagner Model, which focuses on learning associations between stimuli and responses, and Thompson Sampling, a decision-making algorithm used for reinforcement learning.
